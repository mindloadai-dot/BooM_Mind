### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mindload.git

## 🔧 GitHub Features to Enable

### 1. Issues
- Go to Settings → Features
- Enable "Issues" for bug reports and feature requests
- Enable "Discussions" for community support

### 2. GitHub Pages (Optional)
- Go to Settings → Pages
- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: main
- Folder: /docs
- This will create a website for your project

### 3. Branch Protection (Recommended)
- Go to Settings → Branches
- Add rule for `main` branch
- Enable "Require pull request reviews"
- Enable "Require status checks to pass"

## 📝 GitHub Actions (Optional)

Create `.github/workflows/flutter.yml` for CI/CD:

```yaml
name: Flutter CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      with:
        flutter-version: '3.6.0'
        channel: 'stable'
    
    - run: flutter pub get
    
    - run: flutter analyze
    
    - run: flutter test
    
    - run: flutter build apk
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### 1. Sensitive Files
The following files are **NOT** included in the repository (protected by .gitignore):
- `google-services.json` (Firebase Android config)
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` (Firebase iOS config)
- `.env` files (environment variables)
- `firebase_options.dart` (Firebase options)

### 2. API Keys
- Never commit API keys to GitHub
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Consider using GitHub Secrets for CI/CD

### 3. Firebase Configuration
- Keep Firebase config files local only
- Share configuration instructions in README.md
- Use Firebase CLI for deployment

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Large File Size**

   # If you have large files, consider Git LFS
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.pdf"
   git lfs track "*.mp3"
   git lfs track "*.mp4"
   ```

   ```bash
   # Use personal access token instead of password
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mindload.git
   ```

3. **Branch Issues**
   ```bash
   # If main branch doesn't exist
   git checkout -b main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
