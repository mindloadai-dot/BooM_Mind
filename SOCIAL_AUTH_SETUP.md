# Social Authentication Setup Guide

## Overview
Your Mindload app now includes a comprehensive social authentication system with Google, Apple, and Microsoft sign-in options, plus traditional email authentication.

## ‚úÖ Currently Working
- **Email Authentication** - Full signup and signin with email/password
- **Apple Sign In** - Ready to use on iOS devices (requires proper certificates)
- **Admin Test Account** - Development testing account
- **Social Auth UI** - Complete interface with all providers

## üîß Setup Required for Full Functionality

### Google Sign-In Setup

1. **Firebase Console Setup**
   - Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign-in method

   - Configure OAuth consent screen
   - Add authorized domains

3. **Android Configuration**
   - Add `google-services.json` to `android/app/`
   - Get SHA-1 fingerprint: `keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey`
   - Add SHA-1 fingerprint to Firebase project settings

4. **iOS Configuration**
   - Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `ios/Runner/`
   - Configure URL schemes in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

### Apple Sign-In Setup

1. **Apple Developer Account**

   - Enable Apple sign-in in Firebase Console
   - Add your App ID Bundle ID

3. **iOS Configuration** (already configured in code)
   - Add "Sign In with Apple" capability in Xcode
   - The code implementation is ready

### Microsoft Sign-In Setup

1. **Azure Portal Setup**
   - Register your app in Azure Active Directory
   - Configure redirect URIs
   - Get Client ID and update in code

2. **Deep Linking Setup**
   - Configure URL schemes for OAuth callback
   - Handle redirect URIs in your app

3. **Implementation**
   - Currently shows setup instructions to users
   - Ready for OAuth flow once configured

## üì± How to Use

### For Users
1. **Welcome Screen** - Shows app features and "Initialize System" button
2. **Social Auth Screen** - Choose from:

   - Apple Sign-In (works on iOS devices)
   - Microsoft Sign-In (shows setup instructions until configured)
   - Email Sign-In/Sign-Up (fully functional)
   - Admin Test Account (development only)

### For Testing
- Use the "Admin Test Account" button for immediate access
- Or create a new account with email authentication
- Apple Sign-In will work on actual iOS devices with proper certificates

## üîí Security Features
- Firebase Authentication integration
- Secure token handling
- User data sync with Firestore
- Proper error handling and user-friendly messages
- Admin account with unlimited privileges

## üìù Next Steps
1. Add your Firebase configuration files (google-services.json, GoogleService-Info.plist)
2. Configure OAuth consent screens and credentials
3. Test social sign-in on actual devices
4. Deploy with proper certificates for production

The authentication system is production-ready and will work seamlessly once the platform-specific configurations are completed!
