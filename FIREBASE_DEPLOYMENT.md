# Firebase Deployment Guide for Mindload

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying your Mindload app's Firebase configuration to production.

## üî• Firebase Configuration Overview

Your Mindload project includes complete Firebase integration with:

- **Authentication** - Face ID, email, Google, Apple sign-in
- **Firestore Database** - Study sets, user progress, quiz results
- **Cloud Storage** - Document uploads (PDF, text files)
- **Cloud Messaging** - Push notifications for study reminders
- **Security Rules** - Production-ready access controls

## üìÅ Configuration Files

### 1. firebase.json
Main Firebase project configuration file specifying:
- Firestore rules and indexes deployment targets
- Hosting configuration for web deployment
- Storage rules deployment

### 2. firestore.rules
Production-grade security rules ensuring:
- User data isolation (users can only access their own data)
- Authenticated access for all operations
- Proper validation for data writes
- Admin-only access for system collections

### 3. firestore.indexes.json
Optimized composite indexes for:
- User study sets queries (by date, difficulty, study count)
- Quiz results filtering and sorting
- Credit usage tracking
- Notification records analytics
- 16 total composite indexes for fast queries

### 4. storage.rules
Secure file upload rules for:
- User documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, EPUB) - 50MB limit
- Profile images (JPEG, PNG, GIF) - 5MB limit
- Shared study materials access
- File type and size validation

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login to Firebase: `firebase login`
3. Select your project: `firebase use --add`

### Deploy Firestore Rules and Indexes
```bash
# Deploy Firestore security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy Firestore indexes (may take 10-20 minutes)
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

# Deploy Storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage
```

### Deploy Web App (Optional)
```bash
# Build Flutter web
flutter build web

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Full Deployment
```bash
# Deploy everything at once
firebase deploy
```

## üîí Security Features

### Firestore Security
- **User Isolation**: Each user can only access their own data
- **Authentication Required**: All operations require valid Firebase Auth
- **Data Validation**: Proper timestamp and user ID validation
- **Admin Collections**: System data protected from client access

### Storage Security
- **File Type Validation**: Only allowed document and image types
- **Size Limits**: 50MB for documents, 5MB for images
- **User Folders**: Strict user-based folder access
- **Public Assets**: Controlled public access for shared materials

### Authentication
- **Multi-Provider**: Email, Google, Apple, Face ID support
- **Token Management**: Automatic device token refresh
- **Session Handling**: Proper sign-in/sign-out cleanup

## üìä Database Schema

### Core Collections
- `users` - User profiles and preferences
- `study_sets` - AI-generated flashcards and quizzes
- `quiz_results` - Performance tracking and XP
- `user_progress` - Streaks, levels, achievements
- `credit_usage` - Daily AI usage limits
- `notifications` - Push notification preferences
- `notification_records` - Notification analytics

### Query Optimization
- Compound queries for filtering by user + date/score/type
- Array-contains indexes for tags and tokens
- Proper field ordering for performance
- TTL settings where applicable

## üéØ Production Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Update Firebase project ID in firebase.json
- [ ] Verify all API keys in firebase_options.dart
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Validate Firestore security rules
- [ ] Test file upload/download functionality
- [ ] Configure FCM for push notifications

### After Deployment
- [ ] Monitor Firestore usage and costs
- [ ] Set up Firebase Performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure crash reporting
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Monitor security rule logs
- [ ] Test end-to-end functionality

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable offline persistence
- [ ] Configure proper cache sizes
- [ ] Monitor query performance
- [ ] Optimize large document reads
- [ ] Implement pagination for lists

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

### Firebase Console
- Authentication users and sign-in methods
- Firestore document counts and query performance
- Storage usage and transfer metrics
- Cloud Messaging delivery rates

### Performance Monitoring
- App start times and screen transitions
- Network request latencies
- Crash reporting and stack traces
- User engagement metrics

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Denied**: Check Firestore security rules
2. **Index Required**: Deploy missing indexes from console
3. **Storage Upload Fails**: Verify file type/size limits
4. **Push Notifications Not Working**: Check FCM token handling

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test Firestore rules locally
firebase emulators:start --only firestore

# Validate security rules
firebase firestore:rules:list

# Check deployment status
firebase deploy:status
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit real API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
3. **Regularly audit security rules** and access patterns
4. **Monitor for unusual usage patterns** in Firebase Console
5. **Keep Firebase SDKs updated** to latest versions
6. **Enable App Check** for additional security (recommended)

## üìû Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check Firebase Console for error logs
2. Review Firebase CLI documentation
3. Test with Firebase Emulator suite locally
4. Contact Firebase Support for project-specific issues
